## The Process
Let's see how we are going to conduct this workshop virtually but at the same time being interactive.
- Every content of the workshop would be practiced with hands-on labs and exercises,
- Everyday we are going to organize a short quiz at the end of the session to re-remember everything we have learnt so far,
- Everyday comes with a new challenge, which would be very short (can take upto 10 minutes max.) to implement what we have learnt,
- Everyday a CheckIn form will be provided to get the feedback and questions for the day, this doesn't means one couldn't ask questions during the sessions.

## Pre-requisities
- No prior coding experiences required,
- Frankly, we don't have any pre-requisities for the workshop.
